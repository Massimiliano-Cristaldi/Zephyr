This is a demo for a messaging webapp, meant as an exercise with React and Typescript rather than an actual product.
While the frontend is fully fleshed out, the backend is just a mimicry that allowed me to test functionalities by posting to a local database.

Key features:
- Add contacts, create groups, switch to different profiles
- Save users into your contact list with custom nicknames
- Text messages, audio messages and attachments, with the ability to reply to your own or others' messages
- Emojis and text-styling (bold, italics, underlined)
- Deeply customized UI, that allows the user to change every color in the app, fonts and more

Though not optimized, this project is archived.
